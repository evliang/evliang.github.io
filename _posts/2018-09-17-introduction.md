The purpose of this blog is to motivate myself to accomplish more with my life.

My hope is that if I blog at least once a week about what I've been doing, then I'll naturally find things to share.

The subjects I expect to talk about:
- Various things that bother me
- The side projects that I come up with to solve those problems
- F#, Elixir, and why Functional Programming is all that
- The immense effort I put into some things, all to be a little lazy
- My setup and workflows in order to be productive when I need to be
- Some of the random things I think about
