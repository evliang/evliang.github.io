The purpose of this blog is to motivate myself to accomplish more with my life.

My hope is that if I blog at least once a week about what I've been doing, then I'll naturally find things to share.

The subjects I expect to talk about:
- Various side projects that I am working on or have completed
- F#, Elixir, and why Functional Programming is the shiznit
- The efforts I make in order to remain productive
- Some of the random things I think about
